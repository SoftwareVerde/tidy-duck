=======================
Rebuilding the WAR file
=======================

After obtaining the new code-based, ensure the production database configuration
is (still) set in:

    app/src/production/resources/server.conf

Then run:

	scripts/make.sh

This will generate an updated WAR file and echo its location.

=====================
Installing the update
=====================

Transfer the WAR file to the server to be updated and move it to your tomcat
webapps directory as ROOT.war.  For example:

	/var/lib/tomcat/webapps/ROOT.war

The permissions should be maintained but is necessary see the INSTALL file for how
to appropriately set the permissions.

Tomcat should automatically detect that the WAR file has changed and
unpackage/deploy it.  You should then be able to access the application
through your browser.
