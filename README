Tidy Duck is an application for building and maintaining MOST
(http://www.mostcooperation.com/) function catalogs.

The function catalogs use a model that introduces interfaces (collections of
functions that can be applied to one or more function blocks) as well as
function stereotypes that provide additional restrictions to the kinds of
properties and methods that can be created.

For installation instructions, see the accompanying INSTALL file.

Tidy Duck was developed by Software Verde, LLC in 2017.
